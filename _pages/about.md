I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com), building recommender systems to make commerce better for everyone. My previous roles include developing financial ML solutions for small businesses at [Wave HQ](https://www.waveapps.com) and engineering machine learning systems for automated feeding in aquaculture at [ReelData AI](https://www.reeldata.ai). With a Master's in Computer Science from [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/computerscience.html) (where I was affiliated with [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai) and [DeepSense](https://deepsense.ca/)), a Computer Engineering Master's from [Sharif University of Technology](http://www.en.sharif.edu/) focused on parallel computing, and a Computer Engineering B.Sc. from the [University of Tabriz](https://tabrizu.ac.ir/en), I've built a diverse foundation in both theoretical and applied machine learning.
